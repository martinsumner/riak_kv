# Riak KV

![Riak KV OpenRiak Status](https://github.com/OpenRiak/riak_kv/actions/workflows/erlang.yml/badge.svg?branch=openriak-3.4)

## Overview

Riak KV is an open source Erlang application that is distributed using the [riak_core](https://github.com/OpenRiak/riak_core) Erlang library. Riak KV provides a key/value datastore and features MapReduce, lightweight data relations, and several different client APIs.

## OTP version support

Riak is built on top of the [Erlang/OTP platform](https://github.com/erlang/otp).  Supported versions for this release are:

![OTP Recommended](https://img.shields.io/badge/OTP_Recommended_Version-_OTP_26_-green)

![OTP Supported](https://img.shields.io/badge/OTP_Backwards_Compatible-_OTP_24_-blue)

For later OTP versions, an alternative `openriak-<release>` branch will be required.  See [the roadmap discussion](https://github.com/orgs/OpenRiak/discussions/19) for further details.

## Quick Start

You should have [Erlang/OTP 26](http://erlang.org/download.html) to compile and run this version Riak KV. The easiest way to utilise Riak KV is by installing the full Riak application available on [Github](https://github.com/OpenRiak/riak).
